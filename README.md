# Movie App

This movie application provides users with an extensive collection of films, allowing them to explore detailed information about each movie. Users can search for specific films and delve into their details. Additionally, the app enables users to watch trailers and video clips related to each film. 

## Overview
- This project embraces a robust development approach by incorporating Multi-Module, MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel), and Clean Architecture principles.


## Multi-Module
- The modular structure enhances maintainability, scalability, and extensibility.
- Each module can be developed independently, fostering code organization and minimizing dependencies.

## Clean Architecture
- Clean Architecture principles are applied to each feature module in this project.

## MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)
- MVVM provides a clear separation between the user interface (View) and business logic (ViewModel), promoting code readability.
